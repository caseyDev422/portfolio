                <h4>Hello, my name is Sean Casey. I've been a developer for a few years now. I mainly focus on building full stack web applications, but also enjoy learning
                    about new technologies that allow me to venture out into other fields in technology. One interest that has caught my attention is game development. 
                    I would like to be able to create my own game(s) one day. Listed below are some of my skills. Some of my hobbies besides coding include weight lifting,
                    gaming, watching movies, and reading.
